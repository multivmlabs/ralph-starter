## [0.3.3] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- **`ralph-starter figma` wizard command**: Interactive 4-step design-to-code workflow (Figma URL, task description, tech stack auto-detection, smart model selection)
- **Full Figma API property coverage**: Layout sizing modes, individual strokes, rotation, font style/weight, text truncation, opacity, blend modes, and more
- **Figma parsers**: Font checker with web-safe substitutions, image collector, icon collector, plan generator for multi-section builds
- **Agent design-to-code guidelines**: Comprehensive layout, colors, typography, sizing, borders, shadows, images, and responsive rules injected into agent context
- **Security sanitization utilities**: `sanitizeAssetFilename`, `isValidFigmaCdnUrl`, `sanitizeSvgContent` (substring-based parser), `isValidPngBuffer` for all Figma asset downloads

### Fixed
- Division-by-zero in `imageTransformToObjectPosition` (epsilon-based guard)
- TOCTOU race conditions in Figma cache read (fd-based atomic stat+read) and image optimizer (buffer-based processing)
- Eliminated redundant `existsSync` guards before `mkdirSync({ recursive: true })`

### Security
- SVG sanitization rewritten from regex to substring-based state machine to pass CodeQL static analysis
- PNG magic byte validation on all downloaded image buffers
- Figma CDN URL allowlist validation (`.figma.com`, `.amazonaws.com`, `.cloudfront.net`)

## [0.1.1-beta.17] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **`fix --design` mode**: Structured 5-phase visual fix workflow with screenshot verification, CSS cascade conflict detection, and `DESIGN_VERIFIED` completion token
- **Smart UI defaults**: Web projects now default to Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + motion-primitives when no styling is specified (framework-aware: shadcn-vue for Vue, shadcn-svelte for Svelte)
- **`uiLibrary` field** in TechStack for explicit UI component library selection
- **Rich spec generation**: Specs and AGENTS.md now include Tailwind v4 setup notes, CSS cascade layer warnings, and shadcn component setup instructions

### Fixed
- Design loop premature exit — `fix --design` now requires explicit `DESIGN_VERIFIED` token after visual confirmation (prevents 1-iteration false completions)
- Design loop stall detection — screenshot/viewport analysis no longer falsely triggers idle detection
- Default design iterations increased from 5 to 7 for more thorough visual fixes

### Changed
- Completion instruction in agent preamble is now conditional — design mode uses task-specific completion flow instead of generic "All tasks completed"
